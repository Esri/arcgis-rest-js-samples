# ArcGIS REST JS + Native Browser Modules

## Running this sample

For this sample, you do not need to install any dependencies - it uses ArcGIS REST JS from the Unpkg CDN. To run this sample, you just need to host the `index.html` file. There are a variety of ways to do that; one simple way is to use the [serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve) package:

```bash
npx serve
```

### Local ArcGIS REST JS

If you'd like to use a local version of ArcGIS REST JS, follow the [steps in the parent README](../README.md#local-arcgis-rest-js-browser), updating the script tags in these files as necessary:

- `index.html`
